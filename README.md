# Dance Redemption

Dance Redemption is a game about dance battling lost souls trapped in Hell in order to purify and redeem their souls.\
It was developed over the course of approximately three weeks for the CMPT 230 final project, using the open-source game engine **Godot** and it's built-in language, **GDScript**.

## Mechanics

The primary mechanic is the dance battle system, which follows a similar formula to that of _Dance Dance Revolution_ or _Osu 4K_.\
There are also some other basic mechanics, such as the simple interaction and dialogue systems, but the real meat and potatoes of the project lies within the dance system.
